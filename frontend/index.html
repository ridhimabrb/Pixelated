    <p class="tagline"><strong>An emotion-aware journaling system.</strong></p>

  <p>
    Pixelated started as an idea to preserve not just memories,
    but the emotions behind them. Text fades, dates blur, but
    patterns of feeling tell a deeper story.
  </p>

  <p>
    At its core, Pixelated is a <strong>sentiment analysis system</strong>.
    Every journal entry is processed using modern NLP models from
    Hugging Face to identify emotional tone and intensity.
  </p>

  <p>
    These emotions are mapped visually across an entire year —
    each day becoming a pixel, each color representing how it felt.
    Over time, this forms a data-driven memory archive of 2026.
  </p>

  <p>
    Pixelated is both a personal memory tool and a technical project
    that explores human emotion through AI, data visualization,
    and minimalistic design.
